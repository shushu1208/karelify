# karelify

*More Karel = More Awesome*

### Project Description
Create a browser extension or add-on (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) that replaces all of the images on a webpage with Karel the Dog.

When the extension button is clicked, the extension should "karelify" the page by replacing each image with a Karel image randomly selected from the `images` file.

### Demo
Here's one possible implementation in Chrome with Karel the Dog making the front page of YouTube:
